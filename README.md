Fetch-API is my end of year project that i worked on during my internship with APM Terminals, this API is capable of getting JSON file from a certain link and a giving
intervelle then storing the obtained data in a mongodb document but not before testing if that data already exist or only updates to avoid unneeded doubles.
This API also has an automated date function that updates itself with no need to enter the date manually, and is able to perfectly seperate the obtained data every 24h
to avaoid confusion.
This API works best with a software called "3T studio" that helps automating the task and help transforming the JSON data stored in mongodb document into an SQL table.
